  "Amazing. Takes great pictures! It has lots of settings to play with. Comes out instantly.",
  "I would consider this camera one of my best rentals of all time. I am totally in love with every photo that I take with it. It's very easy to operate and absolutely worth it. I try to use it as often as I can! â™¥",
  "Nostalgically fabulous!!! SO cute. And retro looking... Even though no old camera ever looked like this.",
  "I love how raw the pictures look :) don't expect them to look HD with perfect lighting like your phone provides: but authentic and real.",
  "Honesty, this is the best camera film i ever had. I don't know why people complain about its exposure and all.",
  "This cute camera came in really fast in perfect condition. Pretty straight forward on how to use it and fun to capture memories to be cherished forever, right there on the spot.",
  "I just wanna say that I love this! I just take pictures of everything. I even took a pic of my door and let me just say that this camera just made my door look like an awesome door.",
  "Overall this camera is a solid performer. It is a jack of all trades. Photos to video, it does a dang decent job on it all with a big emphasis on the video side of things.",
  "Plus, it's easy on the shoulder, nails focus in most situations, captures impressive images and video and is an ideal travel and hiking DSLR.",

  "There's so much to love about this camera that deciding where to start is a challenge.",
  "I also really like the articulated touch screen, it is so convenient!",
  "This camera has amazing ISO. I spent Christmas at a relative's house with a new baby. Unfortunately, the whole house was dimly lit, so I was glad the 70D had some great ISO.",
  "I am in Love with this Camera!!!",
  "Loving this camera body. Low-light performance isn't on par with a full-frame camera of course, but it does well enough for my needs.",
  "This is a great camera. A good balance of the latest technology and affordability.",
  "One of the best things is it focuses on the fly while you are taking movies, which is generally unprecedented.",
  "Love the quality of the images and the autofocus seems to be nearly flawless at finding and tracking moving subjects (like dancers and athletes).",
  "It's more than a beginner's camera. If you have mastered other cameras, you can probably pick this up with no problem.",

  "This Camera I perfect for action photography it is super fast and the autofocus is always right on.",
  "Love love love this camera! Finally a love view option! I use this feature a lot. It has many pros.",
  "Great camera with very good features. I shoot 99% still pics, but the video quality is great and the auto focus in video mode is impressive, things seem to just immediately snap into focus.",
  "Feature filled and yet still easy to use. The touch screen makes on-th-fly changes easy. The variety of focusing and exposure options provides great flexibility in controlling the image.",
  "Great all around camera. I'm a hobbyist but I do a lot of live shows for free entry and beer. I wish it was better in the dark as the autofocus has some issues in low light but that is what the big boy full frames are for.",
